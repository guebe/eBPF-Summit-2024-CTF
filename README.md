# ebpf Summit 2024 Capture the Flag ‚õ≥Ô∏èüêù 

This is the repository containing all the code/files for the CTF for the upcoming (2024) eBPF summit.

## eBPF code

When attempting to use the eBPF code you will need to create the required ebpf headers `cd ebpf` & `./header.sh`. 

## Create the CTF VM

`limactl start ctf.yaml`

## Accessing the VM

You will need at least two shells in order to access both the `emperium` system and the underlying OS in order to interact with the Kernel and eBPF programs.

### First shell

This will connect to the running system and start `emperium`.

`limactl shell ctf sudo /tmp/emperium`

```

### Second shell

The following line will connect through to the VM using SSH, it will also port forward from inside the VM (port 80) to port `8082` on your local machine. The reason for this is to allow the use of code-server to interact with the `eBPF` üêù code.

`ssh -F $HOME/.lima/ctf/ssh.config -L *:8082:0.0.0.0:80 lima-ctf`

To start `code-server` within the VM run the command `sudo chown $USER:$USER $HOME/eBPF; PASSWORD=password code-server --bind-addr=0.0.0.0 > /tmp/code.log &`.

### Code-Server or Vim

To make life as easy as possible we've packaged both Vim and Code-server for you to create and modify Go and eBPF code. To connect to code-server open a browser and point it to the IP address of the host where the `lima` VM is running (not the CTF VM IP, the IP of the hosting machine itself). Connecting to port `8082` will open code-server that will allow you to work inside the CTF VM. The CTF source code is in your home directory!

## Notes:

Clues:

- A hacker from the Zenith system in the employ of the Rebellion managed to get a communication out, whilst the quality was poor technicians managed to enhance enough of the audio to understand that the hacker may have "got it the wrong way around" and that the bpftool might be the best way to fix it.

<details>
<summary>Clues</summary>
<details>
<summary>First Clue</summary>
  
  `bpftool` can be used to list all of the maps
<details>
<summary>Second Clue</summary>
  
  `bpftool` can dump the contents of a specific map **ID**
<details>
<summary>Final Clue</summary>
  
  `bpftool` can update the contents of the specific key/value within a map.

- Our spies managed to extract one of the vital keycodes from the emperium key vaults, they unfortunately deleted the emperium map in the process. Whilst we now have this data `brRz3HVSVzC6RXrBC2Y7`, we're not sure if this will impact the running `emperium` system.

<details>
<summary>Clues</summary>
<details>
<summary>First Clue</summary>
  
  Partially completed code should help you achieve this, you'll need to look at an existing map to understand the key/values
<details>
<summary>Second Clue</summary>
  
  An `eBPF` map will only exist as long as a program has a reference too it, otherwise it will be garbage collected.

- A defector has provided most of the code that is needed in order to create a fake `emperium` mainframe, once up this will be able to "acknowledge" the `emperium` system.
