# ebpf Summit 2024 Capture the Flag ‚õ≥Ô∏èüêù 

This is the repository containing all the code/files for the CTF for the upcoming (2024) eBPF summit.

## Building

Create the required ebpf headers `cd ebpf` & `./header.sh`


The `/emperium` folder contains the code for the **Emperium** system, this is the security system for the Empire's Tie Fighter systems. Access to this system would give the rebels the upper hand when it comes to X-Wing to Tie fighter combat. 

To build the stolen copy of the `emperium` system:

`cd emperium` & `go build`

## Running

In order to run the **Emperium** system, it must be started with `sudo` in order to have the privileges to interact with üêù eBPF, including programs and maps.

## Notes:

When running `emperium` it will create 1000s of maps in order to make it more difficult to find the correct maps (more to do on that). **Currently** there is a go routine that will prod a bunch of the go routines to stop them dissapearing after ~2 minutes.

`sudo SKIPREFRESH=true ./emperium` will start the program without regular "prodding" of the ebpf maps, running the following in another termina:

```
while true
do
sudo bpftool map | grep name | wc -l
sleep 10 
done
```

Should result in somthing like the following:
```
