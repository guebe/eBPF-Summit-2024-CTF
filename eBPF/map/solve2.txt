$ go build
$ sudo ./map
2025/07/13 16:37:25 ERROR map create fail
panic: populating map: putting value: key 1: marshal value: []uint8 doesn't marshal to 20 bytes

...
```

We have to change the map name like printed by the app:
```
	mapSpec.Name = "empire_Yey"
```

We have to change the map key to the value from the task description
```
	mapSpec.Contents = []ebpf.MapKV{
		{Key: uint8(1), Value: []byte("brRz3HVSVzC6RXrBC2Y7")},
	}
```

You have to sleep some time so that the map stays alive (otherwise garbage collected).
Don't forget to import "time" on the top of the file.
```
	time.Sleep(time.Minute * 60)
```

Keep the program running by putting it in the background (Ctrl-Z) and `bg`
