```
go generate
go build
sudo ./redirect
```

We have to fix endianess on three lines:
```
    // something doesn't seem right here
    __u16 source = bpf_ntohs(tcp.source);
    __u16 dest = bpf_ntohs(tcp.dest);

        tcp.dest = bpf_htons(2000);
```

Then we are redirecting authentication to the right port 2000 instead of 2001.

But the answer (TCP ACK) also has to be redirected. Because the answer will
have source port 2000 then (because of our previous redirect). In order to
make the three way handshake work we have to change source port on egress back
to 2001.

```
    ...
    } else {
      // something is missing here
      if (source == 2000) {
        tcp.source = bpf_htons(2001);
        long ret =
            bpf_skb_store_bytes(skb, sizeof(struct ethhdr) + (ip.ihl << 2),
                                &tcp, sizeof(tcp), BPF_F_RECOMPUTE_CSUM);
        if (ret != 0) {
          bpf_printk("Error writing bytes");
        }
      }
```

This is how you can monitor what is going on:
```
sudo tcpdump -i lo -vv
```
